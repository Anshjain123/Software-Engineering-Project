# Software-Engineering-Project -> GHUMANTU


An e-ticket(electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document used for tiketing. It can help in a better crowd management of museums/heritage sites. We are going to 
build a QR based ticketing system for the seamless visitor experience in museum and heritage sites. This project would also require QR scanners at the heritage site but 
for now we will not be considering the hardware part.The objective of our application is to reduce the booking expences by eleminating the need for printing and mailing 
paper documents. Also automating the process would help in keeping a better record of the visitors .Hence in case of any mishappening secure measures can be taken with 
the stored data.It can also improve the sales as the visitor can book,purchase and printout the electronic ticket any time 24 hours a day.
